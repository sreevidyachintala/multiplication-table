# Program: Multiplication tables
* In the program, user should enter any number and the program prints the multiplication table of the given input number using for loop. 
* To iterate 10 times, for loop along with the `range()` function is used. 
* The arguments inside range function is (1, 11) which means, greater than or equal to 1 and less than 11 (which meansS 10).
* Then the multiplication table of variable `num`(given number) is displayed.
